# 4our

Imagine the look on your friend's face as you rotate the Connect4 board only to have four of your discs fall in a line. Or when they think they've won, only to for you to rotate the board and block both of their ways to win. In 4our, you can! Tap on a column to drop a disc. The background colour will change to indicate whose turn it is. Tap and hold the background while rotating the phone to rotate the board in the desired direction.

4our uses the gryoscope sensor to determine when the angular acceleration exceeds a certain value before rotating the board. To avoid accidental rotations when players are passing the phone around, a rotation will only occur when the player has a finger on the screen.
